# 📌 Project Title: **MedCare**

## 📄 Brief Description:<br>

**MedCare** is an AI powered patient care system designed to remove the heavy admin work doctors usually rely on nurses for. Doctors speak naturally to record diagnoses, prescriptions, and treatment notes, and the system converts that voice input into structured data stored securely. Patients can log in to track their medications, check usage instructions, and receive updates, while doctors stay informed through real time summaries and alerts. MedCare creates a smoother, more efficient workflow for both patients and clinicians

## 🎯 Functional & Non-functional Requirements

### 1. Functional Requirements (FR)

#### A. For Doctors (Clinical Operations)

- **FR-01: AI-Assisted Consultation**

  - The system converts doctors’ voice input into text.
  - AI extracts structured clinical data (e.g., symptoms, diagnosis).
  - Doctors review and confirm AI-generated forms before saving data into the `diagnosis` table.

- **FR-02: Prescription Management**

  - Doctors select medications from the medication catalog.
  - The system automatically checks `stock_quantity` before confirming prescriptions to prevent overselling.

- **FR-03: History Retrieval**

  - Doctors can view complete patient timelines, including consultations and diagnoses.
  - Records are sorted chronologically to support informed clinical decisions.

- **FR-04: Clinical Dashboard**
  - Displays daily operational statistics such as total patients treated and pending clinical tasks.
  - Data is retrieved via aggregated database views.

#### B. For Patients (Personal Health Management)

- **FR-05: Medical Record Access**

  - Patients can view their consultation history and doctors’ notes.
  - Access is strictly read-only through the patient portal.

- **FR-06: Medication Tracking**
  - Patients can view active prescriptions along with dosage instructions.
  - Supports better medication adherence and self-monitoring.

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

- **NFR-01: Data Integrity**

  - Foreign Key constraints are enforced to prevent orphaned records.
  - Strict data types are used (e.g., `DECIMAL` for prices, `DATE` for date of birth) to ensure data accuracy.

- **NFR-02: Security**

  - Authentication is fully handled by **Clerk**.
  - The database does not store passwords.
  - Internal `user_id` values directly match external Clerk IDs, ensuring secure identity mapping without redundant fields.

- **NFR-03: Performance**

  - Patient records must be retrieved in under 2 seconds.
  - Indexes are applied to critical lookup columns:
    - `nid_number` for fast patient reception lookup
    - `date` for efficient history sorting

- **NFR-04: Scalability**
  - The database schema is normalized to **Third Normal Form (3NF)**.
  - User profile data is decoupled using Class Table Inheritance, allowing `Users` to be extended as `Patients` or `Doctors`.

## 🧱 Planned Core Entities (brief outline)

![ERD](./public/erd.png)

1.  **Users** (Base Authentication Table)
    - `user_id` (PK), `nid_number`, `phone`, `role` ('Admin', 'Doctor', 'Patient'), `dob`, `updated_at`, `created_at`.
2.  **Patients** (Extends Users - 1:1)
    - `patient_id` (PK, FK -> Users), `updated_at`, `created_at`.
3.  **Doctors** (Extends Users - 1:1)
    - `doctor_id` (PK, FK -> Users), `updated_at`, `created_at`.
4.  **Medications** (Catalog)
    - `medication_id` (PK), `timestamp`, `name`, `description`, `stock_quantity`, `unit_price`, `updated_at`, `created_at`.
5.  **Diagnosis** (Core Transaction/Consultation)
    - `diagnosis_id` (PK), `doctor_id`, `patient_id`, `diagnosis`, `date`, `next_checkup`, `updated_at`, `created_at`.
6.  **PrescriptionsItem** (Junction Table: M:N)
    - `prescriptionitem_id` (PK), `diagnosis_id` (FK), `medication_id` (FK), `quantity`, `guide`, `duration`, `updated_at`, `created_at`.
